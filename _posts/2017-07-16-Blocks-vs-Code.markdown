### Upfront warning - I am a professional software developer, and thus, am incredibly biased towards coding. However I've tried to examine these beliefs and pin them down.

Professional software developers type code for a living, which are instructions to tell a computer what to do.
However, a lot of learn to code programs, particularly for kids, use a drag and drop based approach using blocks.

Notable examples:
- Scratch: MIT based
- Blockly: Google open source
- Hopscotch: iPad app
- Swift playgrounds are an interesting mix, where you create blocks and then drag them.

So do blocks make it easier to code?

+ Removes most typing:

  Kids don't type well. If you have to spend your time looking at your fingers, of course typing code is going to be hard. Dragging doesn't require you to look away from the screen.
+ Works better on iPad.

These make sense for kids. But what about for adults?
Typing may be an issue for adults, but many jobs nowadays that have nothing to do with coding require typing. So I don't think reducing typing is an advantage - unless we think there is a better way to tell computers what to do?

But does it make it visually more wasy to understand?

I don't think so.

In both cases, you need to read the text to understand what is going on. I don't find the block based one easier to read.
What about efficiency? Surely dragging is quicker than typing?
Well.....today's coding tools (like IDEs) make producing code pretty minimal. The automcomplete is fantastic, so I spend most of my time pressing TAB. 

If I've changed my mind about what a variable should be called, I can use a keyboard shortcut and then change the name once.

I can extract code into a method, and my IDE will find similar code elsewhere, and offer to replace the logic with my newly created function.

Sometimes I can even right click, and select an item to create a block of code.

So...typing doesn't actually require so much typing. But is dragging better?
The problem isn't the dragging and dropping, but the clicking in the blocks. With all the examples I've seen so far, the blocks are a simple wrapper around code. That is, the blocks turn into text later on. Tus, the blocks only serve to wrap the code.

So it feels like we're overlaying a typing system 

Then there are a lot of design patterns in coding. Builder pattern, Delegates. It has not been shown that using blocks help implement these design patterns. Perhapes this doesn't matter, you respond. Do we really need to these tools? Well, I have found in the short time that I've been a programmer, is that these design patterns exist for a reason. Coding itself is actually not too difficult.
