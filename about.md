Hi, I'm Caroline Clark. I like coding, drawing and thinking.

Software feels like the easiest way to make something come to life. Nowadays, we have so much memory even in the cheapest computers. Coding languages are getting more human friendly. Most of the world is connected on the internet. I don't think it has ever been possible to create something with so much potental, while investing so little.

I used to work at [Kano](http://www.kano.me) and [Masabi](http://www.masabi.com). Currently I am taking a break to work on stuff for myself (like this website, which I hope you like) and to travel.

I like to learn new things, and am open to opportunities where developing employees is highly prioritised.

Get in touch if you think we could work together.
