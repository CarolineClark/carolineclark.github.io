>This blog post was inspired by a hackathon I went to. In the hackathon, we were required to code using some propriatary software, which used drag and drop blocks. This software was intended for adults, for both amateur and professional coders. 

>I understand why people may want to use drag and drop blocks to make coding more approachable for children and amateurs. However, this post is coming from the point of view of "For a professional software developer, can coding using blocks be better than coding using a keyboard?" I thought the answer was "obviously not", but finding people trying to create block based software suitable for professional coders made me re-evaluate.

Professional software developers type code for a living, which are instructions to tell a computer what to do.
However, a lot of learn to code programs, particularly for kids, use a block based, drag and drop approach.

Notable examples:

- Scratch: MIT based
- Blockly: Google open source.
- Hopscotch: iPad app
- Swift playgrounds are an interesting mix, where you create blocks and then drag them.

So do blocks make it easier to code?

Some possible pros:

+ Removes most typing:

  Kids don't type well. If you have to spend your time looking at your fingers, typing code is going to be hard. Dragging doesn't require you to look away from the screen.
+ Works better on iPad. [Although one might disagree.](https://medium.com/@marcprecipice/coding-on-an-ipad-9ca022736b9e)
+ More friendly looking.
+ Easy to look up functionality, by looking at the selection of blocks.
+ Easier to see code structure.
+ Easier to navigate.

I'd like to examine these points. Remember, I'm considering adults as well as kids.

## Removing typing

Typing may be an issue for people, but many jobs nowadays require typing. Unless we find a better way to tell computers what to do (speaking?), I don't think reducing typing is an advantage.

Code can be very expressive. Imagine writing an essay with blocks. Or an email.

Block based emails:

The above is much smarter than block based coding - it's taking the context of the message and giving you a selection of common responses to pick from, and all that cleverness I'm going to ignore. In the above example, you are limited in how you express yourself.

Perhaps code shouldn't be expressive.

Code can be quite expressive. Can you imagine writing an essay with using blocks? How about an email? I know Apple, Google, SwiftKey etc are all working on predicting what we're going to say Of course, you could argue that when coding, you are mainly using pre-existing 

But do blocks make code visually more wasy to understand?

I don't think so.

In both cases, you need to read the text to understand what is going on. I don't find the block based one easier to read.

What about efficiency? Surely dragging is quicker than typing?

Well.....today's coding tools (like IDEs) make producing code pretty minimal. The autocomplete is fantastic, so I spend most of my time pressing TAB. 

If I've changed my mind about what a variable should be called, I can use a keyboard shortcut, type the name once, and it changes everywhere it's been used.

I can extract code into a method, and my IDE will find similar code elsewhere, and offer to replace the logic with my newly created function.

Sometimes I can even right click, and select an option on a menu to create a block of code.

So...typing doesn't actually require so much typing. But is dragging better?
The problem isn't the dragging and dropping, but the clicking in the blocks, for example to adjust some text. So you don't actually avoid typing. In fact, you have to switch between With all the examples I've seen so far, the blocks are a simple wrapper around code. That is, the blocks turn into text later on. Thus, the blocks only serve to wrap the code.

So it feels like we're simply overlaying a typing system. But surely a typing system is optimised for typing, and the drag and drop blocks . Often the problems I've seen with block based programming is that you have to take a block, and then click into it to change the variable. You actually don't end up getting away from typing.

Then there are a lot of design patterns in coding. Builder pattern, Delegates. It has not been shown that using blocks help implement these design patterns. Perhapes this doesn't matter, you respond. Do we really need to these tools? Well, I have found in the short time that I've been a programmer, is that these design patterns exist for a reason. Coding itself is actually not too difficult.
